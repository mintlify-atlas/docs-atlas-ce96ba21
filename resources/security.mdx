## Reporting Security Issues

The Viaduct team and community take security bugs in Viaduct seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Any security issues should be submitted directly to the [Airbnb bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/airbnb).

## Determining if You Have a Security Issue

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

1. **Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?**
2. **Can I disable something for other people?**

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue.

<Warning>
Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue. If you're unsure, please direct questions to our bug bounty program.
</Warning>

## Security Disclosure Process

1. Submit your findings to the [Airbnb bug bounty program](https://hackerone.com/airbnb)
2. The security team will acknowledge receipt of your report
3. The team will investigate and validate the issue
4. Once confirmed, the team will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing with you
5. You will be credited for your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## What Happens Next?

After you submit a security issue:

- The Viaduct security team will acknowledge your report and begin investigating
- We will keep you informed about the progress of the fix
- We will work with you to understand the scope and severity of the issue
- Once a fix is ready, we will coordinate the disclosure timeline with you
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure in our release notes (if you wish)

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- The Viaduct framework and its core components
- Viaduct Gradle plugins
- Viaduct demo applications
- Any code in the [airbnb/viaduct](https://github.com/airbnb/viaduct) repository

## Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope:

- Issues in third-party dependencies (please report these to the respective projects)
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of exploitability
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks against Airbnb infrastructure

## Security Best Practices

When using Viaduct in production, we recommend:

- Keep Viaduct and its dependencies up to date
- Follow the security guidelines in our documentation
- Implement proper authentication and authorization for your GraphQL endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all production traffic
- Implement rate limiting and query complexity analysis
- Monitor your application for suspicious activity
- Review and audit resolver implementations for potential security issues
